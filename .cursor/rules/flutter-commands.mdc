description: Use full permissions for Flutter commands that write to SDK/cache
alwaysApply: true
---

# Flutter terminal commands

When running these commands in the terminal, **always request full permissions** (e.g. `required_permissions: ["all"]`) so they can write to the Flutter SDK cache and succeed:

- `flutter clean`
- `flutter pub get` (if it fails with permission or cache errors)
- `flutter pub upgrade`
- Any other Flutter CLI command that might touch the Flutter SDK or cache outside the project directory

Without full permissions, such commands can fail with "Operation not permitted" when writing to the Flutter install (e.g. `cache/engine.stamp`).

## iOS physical device

When running on a **physical iPhone** (not Simulator), always use **Release** or the app will crash with "Unable to flip between RX and RW memory protection". Use:

- `flutter run --release -d <device_id>`

See `docs/IOS_DEBUG_CRASH.md` for details and Xcode scheme setup.
